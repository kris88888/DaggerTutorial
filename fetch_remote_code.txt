Fetch latest code from remote origin into the remote branch without bringing in the changes in local branch:
	> git fetch origin <branch_name>

This will fetch latest changes downloaded  from internet into remote branch present locally but it would not impact the working directory a.k.a local branch.

You can view those changes using git checkout origin/remote_branch_name


Fetching latest code from different branch into your local branch.

> git switch local_branch
> git pull origin main

This will bring changes from remote main branch into whatever local branch you are on.

Git Merge Conflict Process:
=================================================

Git merge conflicts are resulting from some changes that you have in local and some changes that other contributors have made in the same file.

The git merge conflicts show up when we have changes in local that haven't been pushed to remote repo and other contributors have touched same files and as soon as we pull the latest repo into our workspace, it pops up merge conflict message.

Steps to resolve:

Git pull origin
>> Resolve the merge conflicts
Git add .
Git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"

1. Check current remote branch:

>git branch -r 

2. If you want to temporarily see what origin branch looked like before your changes.
> git checkout origin/branch_name e.g. git checkout origin/main

This will detach your HEAD from recent commit to the origin/main.

To come back to your latest commit:
> git switch branch_name e.g. git switch main

3. To check all recent commits:
> git log
 
4. Git push origin
> git push --set-upstream origin remote_branch_name
If your current branch is not backing up with the remote branch.

5. Refactor this file to individual command files
